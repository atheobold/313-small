    "text": "SFO Dstinations\nOne of the variables refers to the destination (i.e. airport) of the flight, which have three letter abbreviations. For example, flights into Los Angeles have a dest of \"LAX\", flights into San Francisco have a dest of \"SFO\", and flights into Chicago (O’Hare) have a dest of \"ORD\".\nIf you want to visualize only on delays of flights headed to Los Angeles, you need to first filter() the data for flights with that destination (e.g., filter(dest == \"LAX\")) and then make a histogram of the departure delays of only those flights.\nLogical operators: Filtering for certain observations (e.g. flights from a particular airport) is often of interest in data frames where we might want to examine observations with certain characteristics separately from the rest of the data. To do so, you can use the filter() function and a series of logical operators. The most commonly used logical operators for data analysis are as follows:\n\n== means “equal to”\n!= means “not equal to”\n&gt; or &lt; means “greater than” or “less than”\n&gt;= or &lt;= means “greater than or equal to” or “less than or equal to”\n\nQuestion 4 – Fill in the code to create a new dataframe named sfo_flights that is the result of filter()ing only the observations whose destination was San Francisco.\n\n# Fill in the code for exercise 4 here! \n\nsfo_flights &lt;- filter(nycflights, \n                      dest == )\n\n\nMultiple Data Filters\nYou can filter based on multiple criteria! Within the filter() function, each criteria is separated using commas. For example, suppose you are interested in flights leaving from LaGuardia (LGA) in February:\n\n## Remember months are coded as numbers!\nfilter(nycflights, \n       origin == \"LGA\", \n       month == 2)\n\nNote that you can separate the conditions using commas if you want flights that are both leaving from LGA and flights in February. If you are interested in either flights leaving from LGA or flights that happened in February, you can use the | instead of the comma.\nQuestion 5 – Fill in the code below to find the number of flights flying into SFO in July that arrived early. What does the result of this code tell you?\n\n## Fill in the code for exercise 5 here! \n\nfilter(sfo_flights, \n       month == __, \n       arr_delay &gt; __) |&gt; \n  dim()"

    "text": "Adding Categorical Variables\nWhen we are interested in comparing the distribution of a numerical variable across groups of a categorical variable, we “typically” see people use stacked histograms or side-by-side boxplots. I believe an unsung hero of these types of comparisons is the ridge plot.\nAs introduced in Introduction to Modern Statistics, a ridge plot essentially has multiple density plots stacked in the same plotting window. A key feature of ridge plots is a categorical variable is always on the y-axis, with a numeric variable on the x-axis.\nIn R, we use the geom_density_ridges() function from the ggridges package to create a ridge plot. Yes, this is new, but don’t worry! The function has the same layout as things you’ve seen before.\nQuestion 8 – Fill in the code below to create a ridge plot comparing the lengths of Cutthroat trout between the different types of channels (unittype). Use the trout dataset you filtered above!\nBe sure to add nice axis labels to your plot, which describe the variables being plotted (and their units)!\n\n## Your code for question 8 goes here!\n\nggplot(data = fish, \n       mapping = aes(x = &lt;NUMERICAL VARIABLE&gt;, \n                     y = &lt;CATEGORICAL VARIABLE&gt;)\n       ) +\n  geom_density_ridges() \n\nQuestion 9 – Modify your plot from #8 to incorporate the section of the forest into your plot using either color or facets.\nHint: The fill aesthetic will fill the ridge plots with color.\nQuestion 10 – Based on your plot, how different are the lengths of the Cutthroat trout between the different channel types and forest sections?"

    "text": "Data for Today\nToday we’ll be working with data on lake ice duration for two lakes surrounding Madison, Wisconsin. This dataset contains information on the number of days of ice (ice duration) on each lake for years between 1851 and 2019. These data are stored in the ntl_icecover dataset, which lives in the lterdatsampler package.\nAccording to the EPA, lake ice duration can be an indicator of climate change. This is because lake ice is dependent on several environmental factors, so changes in these factors will influence the formation of ice on top of lakes. As a result, the study and analysis of lake ice formation can inform scientists about how quickly the climate is changing, and are critical to minimizing disruptions to lake ecosystems."

You are expected to justify why you chose each explanatory variable in the Introduction section of your report.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 4-6 sentences describe how the data were collected, the context of the data (e.g., Are they from a study or a publication?), and the background of the research problem (e.g., What question do these data address? Why were the data collected?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may need to look up the publication(s) the data are associated with to obtain information on how they were collected.\n\n\n\nState the question(s) of interest you will address with your statistical analysis. The more specific you define the question of interest here, the easier the rest of the analysis and report will be. The research questions should start with, “What is the relationship between…” and should be as specific as possible. Your Findings section should directly address the question(s) you pose here.\n\n\n\nMethods\nThis section should lay out the steps, decisions, and logic leading to the statistical model you will use to answer the research question of interest.\n\nDescribe the response and explanatory variables, how they were measured and their associated units. For categorical variables, describe the levels of the categorical variable.\nProduce data visualizations exploring the relationship(s) you are interested in investigating, contrasting the need for a second explanatory variable.\n\nFor a multiple linear regression with one numerical variable and one categorical variable, you should produce two visualizations: one with different slopes and one with parallel slopes.\nFor a multiple linear regression with two numerical variables, you should produce three visualizations: one with both explanatory variables included, and two with each explanatory variable on its own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nEvery visualization should have nicely formatted axis labels!\n\n\n\nDescribe what you see in the visualizations, making direct references to the plots!\nOutline the appropriate statistical model you will use to answer the question(s) of interest that you stated previously. Be specific about why the method being used are appropriate for the investigation at hand making direct reference to the visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\nIn this section you will write up your findings for each research question of interest.\n\nFit the statistical model stated at the end of the Methods section\nObtain the coefficients for the model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the get_regression_table() function from the moderndive package to provide nicely formatted output from your regression model.\n\n\n\nWrite out the estimated regression equation for your statistical model.\n\nIf your regression contains categorical variables, you can either write your equation out with indicator variables or write out a different equation for each group.\n\nInterpret in the context of the data the coefficients from the regression equation.\nBased on your visualizations and the regression model, what is your conclusion for the questions of interest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere should be no mention of p-values in your conclusion!\n\n\n\n\nScope of Inference\nWrite a 3-4 sentence statement on what can be inferred from the design of the study and the results of your statistical analysis. Specifically, answer these two questions and comment on their implications:\n\nBased on the sampling method used, what larger population can you infer the results or your analysis onto?\nBased on the design of the study, what type of statements can be made about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables.

You are required to submit your completed reading guides by Monday at midnight.\n\n\nConcept quizzes (every week)\nEach week there will be a short (~10 questions) quiz over the reading and videos from the week. These quizzes are intended to ensure that you grasped the key concepts from the week’s readings. The quizzes are not timed, so you can feel free to check your answers with the textbook and / or videos if you so wish. The quizzes are marked on completion as complete or incomplete. You are required to complete the concept quiz by Tuesday at noon.\n\n\nTutorials (every week)\nYou can think of the tutorials as an “interactive” textbook, as they interweave statistical ideas alongside examples of how to work with data in R and hands-on exercises writing the R code necessary to complete a given task. Each exercise has hints available if you get stuck!\nThe tutorials are work at your own pace, so you can complete them all at once or slowly throughout the week. The lab assignments will require for you to put the skills you learned in the tutorials to work, so you are required to complete each week’s tutorial before Thursday’s lab.\nThe tutorials are marked on completion as complete or incomplete. You will submit a screenshot of the completion page at the end of the tutorial to confirm that you completed the tutorial for the week.

Different from what you may have experienced, lab assignments are graded for “proficiency” of specific learning targets, which describe what you should be able to do after taking this course. You’ll receive a score for each problem on an assignment according to the Success / Not Yet rubric below, as well as feedback to help you improve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nJustification\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful\nThe solution to the problem is correct, legible, and easy to follow, with all reasoning provided. Any error is trivial.\n\n\nGrowing\nThe solution shows growth toward mastering the topic; however, it is incorrect and/or incomplete.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleting Revisions\nAfter the first submission of your lab or critique, you will have the option to retry any problems for which you scored a Growing (G). A written reflection on how your understanding of the problem changed will accompany any revision. If you don’t earn a Success by the second try, you can make an appointment with me to meet during my office hours (or another agreed-upon time) to create a reassessment strategy. You can schedule up to one meeting per week.\nYou can submit up to one revised Lab Assignment or Statistical Critique per week, until Sunday, June 11 at 11:59 pm.\n\n\nReflections on Your Learning\nRevisions must include a reflection describing how you revised your thinking when completing your revision. It’s not enough to say “[x] was wrong, so I fixed it”—you have to talk about why you got [x] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn’t know before? Who or what helped you learn?\n\nIf your revision does not include reflections, I’ll ask you to add them.\nSee some examples of really good reflections here – they’re (mostly) from an introductory statistics class, but I think you’ll get the idea.\n\nSubmit your revision to the same assignment box on Canvas as your original. This helps me keep track of any outstanding revisions each person has."

However, our class is held in a computer laboratory, so bringing a laptop is not required. You are permitted to use the lab computers, but if you would like to take notes on your computer / surface you are welcome to bring it to class."

    "text": "9.1 How can I expect to be treated in this course?\nFollowing Ihab Hassan, I strive to teach statistics so that people will stop killing each other. In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are a sources of strength. One of the greatest failures of Statistics, historically and in the present, has been the exclusion of voices from the field. Everyone here can learn from each other, and doing so is vital to the structure of the course. Significant portions of this course involve group work and discussion in class. Some discussions will touch on sensitive topics. So that everyone feels comfortable participating in these activities, we must listen to each other and treat each other with respect. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn summary: Be good to each other."

    "text": "9.3 What constitutes plagiarism in a statistics class?\nParaphrasing or quoting another’s work without citing the source is a form of academic misconduct. This included the R code produced by someone else! Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes is different.\nEven inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another’s work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. If you are struggling with writing the R code for an assignment, please reach out to me. I would prefer that I get to help you rather than you spending hours Googling things and get nowhere!\nAny incident of dishonesty, copying or plagiarism will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Cheating or plagiarism will earn you a grade of N on the problem or assignment and will remove your ability to submit revisions for that assignment.\nIf you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to ask for clarification.\nFor more information about what constitutes cheating and plagiarism, please see https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating."
