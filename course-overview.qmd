A deep dive into linear models for analyzing multivariate data sets. In this course, you will learn techniques for checking the appropriateness of proposed models, such as residual analyses and case influence diagnostics, and techniques for selecting models. Gain experience dealing with the challenges that arise in practice through assignments that utilize real-world data. This class emphasizes data analysis over mathematical theory.
