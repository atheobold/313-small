This course uses [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) for lab assignments and projects. There is a link to join the STAT 313 Posit Cloud Workspace at the bottom of the Week 1 Module on [Canvas](canvas.calpoly.edu). 

If you have worked with R & RStudio before, I **do not** want you using the local installation of RStudio to work on your Labs / Projects. I cannot help you on your code if things go sideways! If you use Posit Cloud, however, I can "peek in" to your project and help you debug your code. :)
